R Markdown for Gapminder exploration
====================================

Make an R Markdown document that explores a dataset, such as gapminder seen in class. You donâ€™t need an extensive exploration in order to get a good grade here; a basic one will do, not unlike the one done in class, which would be considered sufficient (but less so the more verbatim your submission is). Render your R Markdown to the github\_document output format. Commit both the .Rmd and .md files and push them to GitHub.
